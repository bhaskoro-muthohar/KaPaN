## Data Pre-processing

### Data Sources
All raw data are available under `data` directory, grouped by the source name. Everything under `data/giovanni` is downloaded from [Giovanni](https://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/), everything under `data/opendatajabar` is from [Open Data Jabar](https://opendata.jabarprov.go.id/), etc.

Built with ❤️ by [bhaskoro-muthohar](https://github.com/bhaskoro-muthohar)

## What's this?

- `README.md`: This Document! To help you find your way around
- `streamlit_app.py`: The main app that gets run by [`streamlit`](https://docs.streamlit.io/)
- `requirements.txt`: Pins the version of packages needed
- `LICENSE`: Follows Streamlit's use of Apache 2.0 Open Source License
- `.gitignore`: Tells git to avoid comitting / scanning certain local-specific files
- `.streamlit/config.toml`: Customizes the behaviour of streamlit without specifying command line arguments (`streamlit config show`)

## Local Setup

Assumes working python installation and some command line knowledge ([install python with conda guide](https://tech.gerardbentley.com/python/beginner/2022/01/29/install-python.html)).

```sh
# External users: download Files
git clone git@github.com:bhaskoro-muthohar/kapan.git

# Go to correct directory
cd kapan

# Create virtual environment for this project
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
. ./venv/bin/activate
# .\venv\Scripts\activate for Windows

# Install required Packages
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the streamlit app
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
